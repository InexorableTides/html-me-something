                    <h2>Gaming</h2>
					<p>Through most of my life I've been addicted to video games. There's a sultry, sweet sense of accomplishment when you figure out how to beat a boss, or make it to the end. It started with Contra, and currently is satiated by the NBA2k series from Take Two Interactive. I've enjoyed RPGs most of my life as well, with the most notable being Chrono Trigger, from Squaresoft.</p>

					<h2>Magic: The Gathering</h2>
					<p>There's something about a game that combines the strategy of chess, with mathematics, and enough amazing card titles to feul several bands worth of album names that just amazes me. I've been playing since 8, and recently rediscovered my love for this game. This belongs in a section all by itself, as it is a card game from Dr. Richard Garfield that has been around 25 YEARS! I'm clearly a Dimir girl, although I dabble in Sultai. </p>

					<h2>Music</h2>
					<p>Throughout my life I've always loved music. It started with my dad making me listen to Rush, which became my favorite band at a young age. I love all genres of music, from Jazz to Metal to Hip Hop. </p>
